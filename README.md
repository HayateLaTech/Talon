# Talon
Character Sheet Creator for Star Wars

✔️ i18n support for multi-language

✔️ Export as PDF

## Preamble

While the character sheets of Bastion Kain are super noice, they lack customizability and are not translatable due to the fact they're saved in the PDF format.

This I wanna change with this smol project, turning the sheet into interactive forms and making translating as easy as possible 😸

It's named after the best Sith for obvious reasons 😈
